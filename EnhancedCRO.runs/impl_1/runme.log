WARNING: [Place 30-120] Sub-optimal placement for a BUFG-BUFG cascade pair. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	encro/lowbuf1 (BUFG.O) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y0

Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two BUFGs can be used if they are placed in cyclically adjacent BUFG sites and both are in the same half (TOP/BOTTOM) side of an SLR. If this condition cannot be met, it is recommended that a BUFH be connected in series between the two BUFGs to ensure that clock region partitioning will account for the use of a clock spine for this connection.

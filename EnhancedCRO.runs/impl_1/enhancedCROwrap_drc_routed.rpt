2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTLP-2#1 Warning
Combinatorial Loop Allowed  
2 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. This loop has been identified in the constraints as being known and understood by use of the ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS property on a net in the loop. The cells in the loop are: encro/nandd, encro/nandu.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net NS is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin FSM_onehot_NS_reg[14]_i_2/O, cell FSM_onehot_NS_reg[14]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net crores/sela_reg[3]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin crores/sela_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell crores/sela_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLBUFGOPT-1#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections to BUFG  
A non-muxed BUFG encro/lowbuf2 is driven by another global buffer encro/lowbuf1. Remove non-muxed BUFG if it is not desired
Related violations: <none>

PLBUFGOPT-1#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections to BUFG  
A non-muxed BUFG encro/upbuf2 is driven by another global buffer encro/upbuf1. Remove non-muxed BUFG if it is not desired
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-1#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a BUFG-BUFG cascade pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two BUFGs can be used if they are placed in cyclically adjacent BUFG sites and both are in the same half (TOP/BOTTOM) side of an SLR. If this condition cannot be met, it is recommended that a BUFH be connected in series between the two BUFGs to ensure that clock region partitioning will account for the use of a clock spine for this connection.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	encro/lowbuf1 (BUFG.O) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y0
	encro/lowbuf2 (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y2
	encro/lowmux (BUFGCTRL.I1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y3

Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
51 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are sevensegm/ctworo/countforss/bcounto[31:0], sevensegm/ctworo/countforss/rcounto[18:0].
